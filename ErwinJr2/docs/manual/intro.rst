Introduction
===============

OneDQ is a cross-platform software with a combination of: 

1. a C library for solving 1D quantum problem and the related thermal and electrical problems;
2. a Python interface for the C library;
3. a set of Python modules for loading, saving, organizing, solving quantum eigen-states in 
   semiconductor quantum wells or super lattices, and calculating relevant physics parameters 
   for these states, especially for quantum cascade laser (QCL) design purposes; 
4. a GUI front-end interface for the above Python modules.

The C library is based on ANSI C and is tested using GCC (under Linux and MacOS) and Visual 
Studio (on Windows). It also has optional OpenMP support for parallel computing if the 
environment supports. 

The C library Python interface is based on :py:mod:`ctypes` in standard Python library and 
:py:mod:`numpy`. 
The Python module for simulation adds :py:mod:`scipy.constants` requirement for scientific constants, 
and uses :py:mod:`json` for saving and loading super-lattices (or quantum wells) information. 

The GUI interface is based on :py:mod:`PyQt5` and :py:mod:`matplotlib`. 


About QCL
----------
Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are semiconductor lasers that emit light
through inter-subband transitions.
These lasers consist of periodic series of thin
layers of various semiconductor materials which creates a one-dimensional
multiple-quantum-well confinement.
Compare to conventional semiconductor lasers which use single material,
QCLs have the advantage of both a higher output efficiency
due to possible quantum cascades across different quantum wells,
and an improved flexibility in tuning the frequencies.
