Welcome to ErwinJr2's documentation!
=====================================

ErwinJr2 is a cross-platform software for modeling quantum problems in 1D semiconductor
super lattices. It is specifically optimized for Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) simulation, 
but coded in a way that's easy to use for general problems about static state in finite
and periodic quantum wells. 

See `Github <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/ErwinJr2/>`_ for the source code.
